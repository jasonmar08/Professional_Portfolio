## Description

When brainstorming my portfolio's development approach, I grappled with using one of the amazing public templates already set up for me, or building it from scratch. Being the life-long student I am, I ultimately decided to start from the ground-up, and am proud to have made this decision. I truly enjoyed designing a portfolio that would showcase my background in biology/healthcare and incorporate the beautiful city of Miami where I grew up in. Adding these personal touches and building out the component hierarchy of my application, as well as implementing animations and a functioning contact form from scratch was truly enjoyable. Although I plan to continously optimize my portfolio as I progress in my Software Engineering journey, I am proud of the current product and hope you enjoy learning a bit more about this Miami native who transitioned into tech to make a larger impact in his community.
